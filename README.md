## Scripts to setup my dev-env

Hello! This repository contains bash scripts I use to setup my dev-env.
As these are fairly recent, they aren't rebust and might throw errors.
Using these as reference to create your own scripts is one way to go!


### What do they do?

There are a few scripts, which check for tools I use, and install them if not present on the system.
They also add configuration files which I have stored in other repos.


### Assumtions
    - I am running these scripts on a debian-based distro
    - I have sudo permissions
    - My user is already created


### Further additions

There are a lot of things I would like to add in here, including the below which I have in mind:
    - [ ] linking the scripts to the main script and ask for user input to install only what he wants
    - [ ] add python installation script (using apt)
    - [ ] install pip, virtualenv, ipython3 and other modules I regularly use
    - [ ] bash functions file, containing all custom functions I created to make life easier
    - ...and hopefully many more
